Here's a specific test methodology to evaluate and reproduce LLM consistency in code quality analysis for a white paper:

## Test Design

1. **Corpus Creation**
   - Select 100 Python files from diverse sources (50 from open-source projects, 50 from proprietary codebases with permissions)
   - Ensure representation across domains: web apps, data science, systems programming, etc.
   - Include files of varying quality (pre-measured via established tools like SonarQube)
   - Size range: 100-1000 lines per file to test scale effects

2. **Reference Measurements**
   - Have 5 senior developers independently assess each file using a standardized rubric
   - Run industry-standard static analysis tools (SonarQube, Pylint, etc.) with identical configurations
   - Create a composite "ground truth" score combining human and tool assessments

3. **LLM Testing Protocol**
   - Test at least 3 different LLMs (e.g., Claude 3.7, GPT-4, local open-source model)
   - Create a standardized prompt template asking for technical debt analysis
   - Run each analysis 10 times per file per model (3,000 total analyses)
   - Space out runs over time (days/weeks) to account for potential model changes

4. **Standardized Output Format**
   - Define a structured JSON output format all LLMs must produce
   - Include numerical scores (0-100) for specific categories: maintainability, reliability, security, performance
   - Require identification of top 5 issues with severity ratings
   - Mandate a final aggregate score

## Measurement Methodology

1. **Variance Calculation**
   - Calculate standard deviation of scores for each file across the 10 runs
   - Report mean, median, and distribution of variances
   - Analyze variance patterns by code complexity

2. **Accuracy Assessment**
   - Measure deviation from "ground truth" reference scores
   - Calculate correlation coefficients between LLM and reference ratings
   - Perform both Pearson (linear) and Spearman (rank-order) correlations

3. **Cross-Model Consistency**
   - Compare rankings produced by different LLMs with Kendall's Tau
   - Identify systematic biases in specific models
   - Analyze agreement on critical issues detection

4. **Categorical Analysis**
   - Break down consistency by issue type (e.g., security vs. performance)
   - Identify which technical debt categories show highest/lowest variance
   - Analyze false positive and false negative rates by category

## Reproducibility Assurance

1. **Public Dataset Creation**
   - Open-source portion of code corpus released publicly
   - Synthetic code examples created for problematic patterns in proprietary code
   - All prompts and testing scripts published on GitHub

2. **Versioning Control**
   - Document exact model versions and API parameters
   - Record timestamps of all evaluations
   - Track any model updates during testing period

3. **Statistical Rigor**
   - Bootstrap confidence intervals for all key metrics
   - Apply ANOVA to identify significant factors in variance
   - Use mixed-effects models to account for file-specific characteristics

4. **Independent Verification**
   - Partner with academic institution for study replication
   - Create containerized environment to reproduce entire experiment
   - Provide detailed methodology allowing third parties to extend with new models

## Reporting Standards

1. **Comprehensive Data Tables**
   - Raw scores for all runs
   - Variance statistics broken down by model, code complexity, and issue type
   - Correlation matrices between LLMs and reference scores

2. **Visualization Suite**
   - Box plots showing score distributions by file
   - Heat maps of issue detection consistency
   - Cumulative distribution functions of variance

This methodology would produce robust, reproducible evidence of LLM consistency in code quality analysis, with sufficient detail for other researchers to verify and build upon the findings.
